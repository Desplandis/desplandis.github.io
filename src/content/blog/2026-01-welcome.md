We're excited to launch the redesigned iTowns website, built from the ground up to serve our community with clarity, transparency, and technical credibility.

## What's New

### Dual-Audience Design
The site now explicitly serves both developers evaluating iTowns for technical fit and decision-makers assessing strategic value and governance.

### Transparent Governance
We've made our commons governance model visible and understandable. You can now see how decisions are made, who participates, and how you can contribute.

### Content-First Architecture
Built with Astro and markdown, the site prioritizes content quality and long-term maintainability over flashy features.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. We'll be adding:
- Comprehensive case studies
- Detailed governance documentation
- Technical deep-dives
- Community spotlights

Stay tuned for updates, and welcome to the new home of iTowns.
