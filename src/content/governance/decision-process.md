## Overview

iTowns operates as a commons, meaning decisions are made collectively by the community of users and contributors rather than by a single vendor or organization.

## Decision Types

### Technical Decisions
- Feature additions and removals
- API changes
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes

**Process:**
1. Proposal submitted as GitHub issue or RFC
2. Community discussion period (minimum 7 days)
3. Technical review by core maintainers
4. Consensus or voting if needed

### Strategic Decisions
- Governance changes
- Membership criteria
- Funding allocation
- Partnership agreements

**Process:**
1. Proposal to governance board
2. Community consultation period (minimum 14 days)
3. Board review and recommendation
4. Community vote if consensus cannot be reached

## Transparency

All decisions and their rationale are documented publicly in:
- GitHub issues and pull requests
- Governance meeting notes
- Decision records on this website

## Getting Involved

You don't need to be a core maintainer to participate in decision-making. All community members can:
- Comment on proposals
- Submit RFCs
- Participate in discussions
- Vote on major decisions (if voting rights granted through contribution)
