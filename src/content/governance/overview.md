## What is iTowns Governance?

iTowns is governed as a **commons** — a shared resource maintained by and for its community of users and contributors. This model ensures:

- **No single point of control**: No company or individual can unilaterally change direction
- **Transparent decision-making**: All decisions and their rationale are public
- **Sustainable development**: Long-term thinking over short-term profits
- **Community ownership**: Users have a voice in the project's future

## Governance Structure

### Community

All users of iTowns are part of the community. Community members can:

- Participate in discussions
- Report issues and request features
- Contribute code, documentation, or resources
- Vote on major decisions (after establishing contribution history)

### Contributors

Regular contributors who have demonstrated commitment to the project:

- Voting rights on technical decisions
- Ability to review and approve pull requests
- Invitation to contributor meetings

### Core Maintainers

Experienced contributors responsible for:

- Day-to-day technical decisions
- Release management
- Code review and quality
- Mentoring new contributors

### Governance Board

Strategic oversight and major decisions:

- Governance policy changes
- Partnership and funding decisions
- Conflict resolution
- Long-term roadmap direction

## Key Principles

### 1. Transparency

All decisions are made in public:
- GitHub discussions for proposals
- Public meeting notes
- Decision records with rationale

### 2. Consensus-Seeking

We aim for consensus rather than voting:
- Discussion before decisions
- Address concerns directly
- Voting as last resort

### 3. Merit-Based Advancement

Advancement based on contribution:
- Code contributions
- Documentation
- Community support
- Governance participation

### 4. Sustainability Focus

Decisions consider long-term health:
- No single-sponsor dependency
- Technical debt management
- Contributor pipeline development

✅ **Reduced Risk**: No vendor lock-in, no single point of failure  
✅ **Predictability**: Transparent roadmap and decision process  
✅ **Influence**: Opportunity to participate in direction
