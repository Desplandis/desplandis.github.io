## Sustainability Model

iTowns maintains financial sustainability through diversified funding sources, ensuring no single organization controls the project's direction.

## Funding Sources

### 1. Organizational Contributions

Organizations using iTowns in production contribute based on a sliding scale:

| Organization Size | Suggested Annual Contribution |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Startup (<50 employees) | €1,000 - €5,000 |
| Mid-size (50-500) | €5,000 - €25,000 |
| Enterprise (500+) | €25,000 - €100,000 |
| Government/Research | Negotiated based on budget |

Contributions are voluntary but encouraged for organizations deriving commercial value.

### 2. In-Kind Contributions

Non-financial contributions are equally valued:

- Developer time for maintenance

In-kind contributions are tracked and recognized alongside financial contributions.

### 3. Grants & Sponsorships

### 4. Support Contracts

## Governance of Funds
