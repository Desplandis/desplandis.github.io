## Challenge

The Example Research Institute needed to visualize and analyze decades of geospatial data to understand urban heat island effects across multiple metropolitan areas.

## Solution

Using iTowns, the team built a web-based 3D visualization platform that:
- Loads and renders multi-temporal satellite imagery
- Overlays 3D building models with thermal data
- Enables interactive exploration of historical trends

## Results

The platform is now used by researchers across three continents and has contributed to multiple published papers on urban climate adaptation.

## Technical Details

- **Data sources:** Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, OpenStreetMap
- **Standards used:** OGC 3D Tiles, WMS, WMTS
- **Deployment:** Static frontend, tile server backend
